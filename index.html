          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>What you should already know</h2>
          <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
              <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
          <hr>

          <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
          <p>
            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

            <br> <br>
            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods. <br> <br>

            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
          </p>

          <h2>Hello World</h2>
          <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the scratchPad
            and write your first "Hello World" Javascript code:</p>
            <div class="exampleBox">
              <p class="exampleTextStyle">
                <br>
                    console.log("hello world");
                <br>
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
            Select the code in the pad and hit ctrl + r to watch it unfold in
            your browser!
          </p>
          <hr>

          <h2>Variables</h2>
          <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.

A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).

You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
          <hr>

          <h2> Declaring variables </h2>
          <p>You can declare a variable in three ways: <br>
          With the keyword var. For example,</p>
          <div class="exampleBox">
            <p class="exampleTextStyle">
              <br>
                  var x = 42;
              <br>
            </p>
          </div>

          <p> This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
          <br> By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
          <div class="exampleBox">
            <p class="exampleTextStyle">
              <br>
                  x = 42;
              <br>
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
          With the keyword let. For example,</p>
          <div class="exampleBox">
            <p class="exampleTextStyle">
              <br>
                let y = 13;
              <br>
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable.
              See Variable scope below. </p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Variable scope</h2>
          <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is
            called a global variable, because it is available to any other
            code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a
            function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only
            within that function. <br>
            JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block
            statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is
            local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides
            within. For example the following code will log 5, because the
            scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is
            declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
            <br>
                </p>
          <div class="exampleBox">
            <p class="exampleTextStyle">
              <br>
                if (true) {var x = 5;} console.log(x); // 5
              <br>
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration
            introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
          </p>


          <div class="exampleBox">
            <p class="exampleTextStyle">
              <br>
                if (true) {let y = 5;} console.log(y); // referenceError: y is
                <br> not defined
              <br>
            </p>
          </div>


          <hr>

          <h2>Global variables</h2>
          <p>Global variables are in fact
            properties of the global object. In web pages the
            global object is window, so you can set and access global
            variables using the window.variable syntax.<br>
            Consequently, you can access global variables declared in
            one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying
            the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called
            phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this
            variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
          <hr>


          <h2>Constants</h2>
          <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with
            the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the
            same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter,
            underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or
            underscore characters.</p>
            <div class="exampleBox">
              <p class="exampleTextStyle">
                <br>
                  const PI = 3.14;
                <br>
              </p>
            </div>
          <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment
            or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to
            be initialized to a value. <br>
            The scope rules for constants are the same as
            those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is
            omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
            <br>
            You cannot declare a constant with
            the same name as a function or variable in the same
            scope. For example: <br> </p>
            <div class="exampleBox">
              <p class="exampleTextStyle">
                <br>
                  // This will cause an Error function f() {}; const f = 5;
                  <br> // This will cause an error also function f()
                  <br> {const g = 5; var g; // statements <br>
                  }
                <br>
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>However, object attributes are not protected,
              so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
              <div class="exampleBox">
                <p class="exampleTextStyle">
                  <br>
                    const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
                  <br>
                </p>
              </div>
              <hr>

            <h2>Data Types</h2>
            <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
              <ul>
                <li>Six data types that are primitives
                    <ul>
                      <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                      <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value.
                        Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the
                        same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.
                      </li>
                      <li>undefined. A top-level property
                        whose value is undefined.</li>
                      <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                      <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                      <li> Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data
                        type whose instances are unique and immutable.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>and Object</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              Although these data types are a relatively
              small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with
              your applications. Objects and functions are the other
              fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects
              as named containers for values, and functions as
              procedures that your application can perform.
              </p>
          <hr>

          <h2>If ... else statement </h2>
          <p> Use the if statement to execute a statement if a
            logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause
            to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if
            statement looks as follows:</p>
            <div class="exampleBox">
              <p class="exampleTextStyle">
                <br>
                  if (condition) { statement_1; }  else { statement_2;}
                <br>
              </p>
            </div>
          <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates
            to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of
            what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates
            to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2
            is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
            statement, including further nested if statements.
            <br>

            You may also compound the statements
            using else if to have multiple conditions tested in
            sequence, as follows: <br>

            <div class="exampleBox">
              <p class="exampleTextStyle">
                <br>
                  if (condition_1) {statement_1;} else if (condition_2) <br>
                  { statement_2;} else if (condition_n) {statement_n;}   <br>
                  else {  statement_last; }
                <br>
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>In the case of multiple
              conditions only the first logical condition
               which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute
               multiple statements, group them within a block
               statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to
               always use block statements, especially
               when nesting if statements:<br>
             </p>
             <div class="exampleBox">
               <p class="exampleTextStyle">
                 <br>
                   if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;} <br>
                   statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                     <br>
                   statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                   <br>
                   statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
                 <br>
               </p>
             </div>

             <p> It is advisable to not use
               simple assignments in a conditional expression, because
               the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing
               over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
               <br>
            </p>
            <div class="exampleBox">
              <p class="exampleTextStyle">
                <br>
                    if (x = y) {/* statements here */}
                <br>
              </p>
            </div>
            <p> If you need to use an assignment in a conditional
              expression, a common practice is to put additional
              parentheses around the assignment. For example: <br>
            </p>

            <div class="exampleBox">
              <p class="exampleTextStyle">
                <br>
                  if ((x = y)) {/* statements here */}
                <br>
              </p>
            </div>


            <hr>


            <h2>While statement</h2>
            <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a
              specified condition evaluates to true. A
              while statement looks as follows:
            </p>
            <div class="exampleBox">
              <p class="exampleTextStyle">
                <br>

                    while (condition) statement
                <br>
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the
              loop stops executing and control passes to the statement
              following the loop.
              <br>

              The condition test occurs
              before statement in the loop is executed.
              If the condition returns true, statement is executed and
              the condition is tested again. If the condition returns
              false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement
              following while.

              <br>

              To execute multiple statements, use a
              block statement ({ ... }) to group
              those statements.
              <br>

              Example:
              <br>
              The following while loop iterates as long as n
              is less than three:
              </p>

              <div class="exampleBox">
                <p class="exampleTextStyle">
                  <br>
                      var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) {n++; x += n;}
                  <br>
                </p>
              </div>



              <p>With each iteration,
                the loop increments n and adds that value
                to x. Therefore, x and n take on the
                following values:
                <ul>
                  <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                  <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                  <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                </ul>
                After completing the third pass,
                 the condition n &lt; 3 is no
                 longer true, so the loop terminates.
              </p>

              <h2>Function declarations</h2>
              <p>A function definition (also
                called a function declaration, or function
                statement) consists of the function keyword,
                followed by:
                <ul>
                  <li>The name of the function.</li>
                  <li>A list of arguments to the
                    function, enclosed in parentheses
                    and separated by commas.
                  </li>
                  <li>The JavaScript statements that
                    define the
                    function, enclosed in curly brackets,
                    { }.


            </li>
                </ul>
              For example, the following code defines a simple function renamed
              square: </p>
              <div class="exampleBox">
                <p class="exampleTextStyle">
                  <br>
                    function square(number) { return number * number; }
                  <br>
                </p>
              </div>

              <p> The function square takes one argument,
                called number. The function consists of one statement
                that says to return the argument of the function
                (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
                statement specifies the value returned by the function.

              </p>

              <div class="exampleBox">
                <p class="exampleTextStyle">
                  <br>
                    return number * number;
                  <br>
                </p>
              </div>

              <p> Primitive parameters (such as a number) are
                passed to functions by value; the value is passed
                to the function, but if the function changes
                the value of the parameter, this change is not
                reflected globally or in the calling function.
              </p>
